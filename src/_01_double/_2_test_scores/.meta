  # Test Scores


  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/testScore.png"/>


  ## Goal:


  Tell the user their grade! Use double variables to allow for decimals,


  ## Steps:


  1. Write code to ask the user for their test score.


  Your program MUST allow the user to enter a test score that has a DECIMAL, e.g.
  75.5

  2. Give them a different message according to their score.


  Example, for a good score: "Wow! You must have studied really hard for that test!"


  HINT: Think about how you would convert a String to an int and use SIMILAR code
  to convert their test score to a double.
