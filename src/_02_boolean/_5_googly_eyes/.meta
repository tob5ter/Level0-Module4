text: "\n\n# Googly Eyes\n\n<hr/>\n<img alt=\"Googly image\" src=\"./images/googlyEyes.png\"\
  />\n\n## Goal:\n\nYou\u2019re going to draw a face with eyes that will follow the\
  \ mouse!\n\n## Steps:\n\n1. Find the Googly Eyes recipe program in Eclipse.\n2.\
  \ Find an image on the internet and copy it to the /images folder. It can be anything\
  \ as long as it has large eyes!\n3. On line 1 of your program (outside of the methods)\
  \ declare a variable for the image:\n```\n   PImage face;\n```\n4. In your setup()\
  \ method, import your image using the following code:\n```\n\n    face = loadImage(\u201C\
  face.jpg\u201D);\n```\n5. If you need to, change the code you just entered so that\
  \ \"face.jpg\" matches the name of your picture.\n6. Set the size of your window\
  \ and the size of your image to be the same by entering the following code in the\
  \ setup method.\n```\n    size(800,600);\n    face.resize(width,height);\n```\n\
  7. In the draw() method, place a white ellipse over the left eye of your image.\n\
  HINT: To find out where to put it, add code to print the mouseX and mouseY where\
  \ you click the mouse.\n8. Now add a pupil (the black part) to the left eye earlier.\n\
  9. Use mouseX and mouseY to move the left pupil where the mouse moves.\n10. Add\
  \ a white ellipse over the right eye using the same technique used for the left\
  \ eye.\n11. Add a right pupil and make it move by using mouseX + [distance from\
  \ left eye] and mouseY + [distance from left eye].\n12. Here\u2019s the tricky part:\
  \ stop the pupils from going outside of the white circles!  To do this, imagine\
  \ a rectangle that the pupil should stay within.  When mouseX and mouseY goes outside\
  \ of these bounds, set it back to the boundary.  Put this code before you draw the\
  \ pupils.\n13. Make sure you SAVE YOUR CODE when you are done.\n\n\n\n"
