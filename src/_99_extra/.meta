  \ Goal:\n\nFind the Creeper!\n\n## Steps:\n\n1. Find the Hide the Creeper recipe\
  \ program in Eclipse.\n2. Set your canvas size\n```\n\nsize(width, height) //in\
  \ settings method\n```\n3. Download a background image. Something with green where\
  \ creeper can hide.\n\nSave the image.\nDrop the file into the /images folder.\n\
  Load it as the background (it must be same size as your canvas)\n```\n\nPImage minecraft\
  \ = loadImage(\"minecraft.png\");     //in setup method\nminecraft.resize(width,\
  \ height);          //in setup method\nbackground(minecraft);          //in setup\
  \ method\n```\n4. Save the image.\n5. Drop the file into the /images folder.\n6.\
  \ Load it as the background (it must be same size as your canvas)\n7. Load the creeper\
  \ image into your sketch\n\nDownload a Creeper image\nDrop the image onto your sketch\n\
  Use the code below to draw the image (make sure you put the code in the right place)\n\
  ```\n\nPImage creeper;     //at the top of your program\ncreeper=loadImage(\"creeper.png\"\
  );     //in setup method\nimage(creeper, mouseX, mouseY);     //in draw method\n\
  ```\n8. Download a Creeper image\n9. Drop the image onto your sketch\n10. Use the\
  \ code below to draw the image (make sure you put the code in the right place)\n\
  11. Right after it\u2019s loaded, resize the creeper image so that it is small and\
  \ can hide.\n```\n\ncreeper.resize(width, height);     //in setup method\n```\n\
  12. Pick a place to hide your creeper.\n\nUse two variables to store the location\
  \ (x and y) of the creeper, and initialize them (at the top of your sketch).\nChange\
  \ your code so that the creeper image is drawn at this location.\n13. Use two variables\
  \ to store the location (x and y) of the creeper, and initialize them (at the top\
  \ of your sketch).\n14. Change your code so that the creeper image is drawn at this\
  \ location.\n15. In the draw method, draw a small red ellipse where the mouse clicks.\n\
  16. If mouseX and mouseY are near the location of your creeper, make the circle\
  \ green.\nNote: you will need to check the x and y values separately if you use\
  \ the code below.\n```\n\nboolean isNear(int a, int b) {\nif (abs(a - b) < 10)\n\
  \     return true;\nelse\n     return false;\n}\n```\n17. Let the user know that\
  \ they found the creeper.\n18. Option: Add more creepers, or move the creeper after\
  \ they find it.\n\n\n\n"
